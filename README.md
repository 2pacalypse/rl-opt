# rl-opt

This is the code for the semester project I did at DIAS/EPFL. It is an implementation
of a deep reinforcement learning based query optimizer. The background and the general design
may be found in the report.

## Guides

- queries2pkl.py assumes you have the join-order-benchmark in the current directory.
this file is responsible for generating a list of Query objects for 113 JOB queries.
The output generated by this file is job_queries.pkl

- split_job_qs.py assumes you have the job_queries.pkl in the current directory.
The output is the split 2 files named job_train_qs.pkl and job_test_qs.pkl.
